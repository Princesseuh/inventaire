# Inventaire

**The description is written in English however the bot itself is only available in French. Sorry!**

A simple Discord bot I wrote for the weekly challenge on the French community [Game Dev Alliance](https://gamedevalliance.fr)

The theme of the week was `Inventaire` (Inventory) so I decided to write a bot to manage my inventory. Unfortunately, she lost all the items I had collected so far in my life.

Thankfully, the users of GDA helped her find everything I lost or at least, everything they thought I had lost..

The bot was online from 15/02/19 to 19/02/19. So.. It's currently running. (yes, this message is written for the future) To participate in this *social experiment*, join the [GDA Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RrBppaj) and say Hi in French to @Inventaire#2445!

On 19/02/19, the results (including full log of who added and removed what) will be included in the repo and this README, stay tuned!

Don't expect good code. This was mostly written in a rush between two [Apex Legends](https://www.origin.com/can/en-us/store/apex/apex) games :)
