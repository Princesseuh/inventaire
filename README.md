# Inventaire

**The description is written in English however the bot itself is only available in French. Sorry!**

A simple Discord bot I wrote for the weekly challenge on the French community [Game Dev Alliance](https://gamedevalliance.fr). The bot was online from 15/02/19 to 20/02/19.

The theme of the week was `Inventaire` (Inventory) so I decided to write a bot to manage my inventory. Unfortunately, she lost all the items I had collected!

Thankfully, the users of GDA helped her find everything I lost or at least.. Everything they thought I had lost.

The logs are available in the `logs` folder. Some items were added by my testers before the public start and are not included in the logs. Unfortunately, on day 4 the bot crashed due to an internet outage and I lost the log for that day (but nothing important happened, I believe no items were added or removed actually). The end database is also included (`database.db`)

The starting inventory had `x4 Potions`, `x4 √âp√©es` (Swords) and `x3 Boucliers` (Shields). Testers added a `butterfly` (the emoji), a `smoking pipe` (or is it? This item is on about 3 level of meta. Sorry) and `the daily satisfaction of having people to rest on and be able to count on them` and removed a `potion` and a `shield`.

Here's the end inventory :

- `x2 Potions` added by `Rika` and removed by `mat_rpg` and Nev`
- `x2 √âp√©e` (Sword) added by `mat_rpg` and removed by `Imanor`, `Nighten Dushi` and `Akamentor`
- `x1 Bonheur` (Happiness) added by `Chester`
- `x1 Bouclier` (Shield) removed by `Phantou`
- `x1 Des chaussures roses avec talons √† l'int√©rieur` (Pink shoes with heels inside) added by `Nolwenn`
- `x1 Rose` (as in, the flower) added by `WereWolf_Evolve`
- `x1 Sandwich` added by `Ikuui`
- `x1 Un bloc de code bien indent√©` (a block of well indented code) added by `Akamentor`
- `x1 Un clavier rose` (A pink keyboard) added by `Aur√©lien`
- `x1 Un controller Nintendo Gamecube‚Ñ¢` (a Nintendo GameCube controller) added by `Imanor`
- `x1 Un fan-art de SinaRun` (A fan-art of [SinaRun](https://store.steampowered.com/app/324470/SinaRun/), that's my game!) added by `Phantou`
- `x1 de la poutine` (some poutine) added by `Nev`
- `x1 sandwich` added by `fant√¥me d√©guis√©e en È¥®È¥® Kamo È¥®È¥®~` (unfortunately, the code was case sensitive)
- `x1 ü¶ã` added by `Mizukewl` (thanks for helping me test the bot before public release!)

Funnily enough, I expected people to troll a lot more than they did. The items added ended up being mostly cute references to me and what I like. Which I guess was to be expected considering the dialogues with the bot implied a lot that they were MY items and I'm a cute girl who like cute (pink) things ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Anyway, it was fun. For those interested in the ranking, I ended up in first place that week.

Thanks to anyone who participated!
